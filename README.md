# WGAbed - a package for handling whole genome alignments

## About

This packages handles the conversion of a whole genome alignment file 
in MAF format to a reference ordered BED format containing all the 
information in the MAF file but in a more accessible format. This 
respository contains scripts for creating a 'whole genome alignment BED' or 
'WGAbed' file as well as scripts for downstream manipulation of the file.

The package was conceived and implemented by PÃ¡draic Corcoran 
(<https://github.com/padraicc>), with additions and later implemented scripts 
by Henry Barton (<https://github.com/henryjuho>).
